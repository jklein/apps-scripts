A collection of small scripts used in Google Apps

color_row.js
---------------------

This is a small script that I use to set a background color for rows in a Google spreadsheet.  Google apps has this functionality natively for some time ranges with conditional formatting (date within past week, month, and year), but I wanted more flexibilty to do this for arbitrary dates.
